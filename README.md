Weekend "Associative Rule" algorithm.

Given pair of (user id , search query)
Discover related search queries.
For query Sx show {Sx} => {Sy} with confidence Cxy using associative rule learning algorithm.

1. The algorithm run over search queries dataset the output should be Sx ,Sy , confidence  Sx => Sy with  confidence
2. The algorithm run with 3 different confidence 0.6 / 0.8 / 0.9
